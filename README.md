## This repo has been replaced
The **[ASP.NET-Core-Basics](https://github.com/elanderson/ASP.NET-Core-Basics) repo** now contains basically everything this repo was trying to do, but layed out it a clearer way. **Please use it for future reference.**

##Below is the orginal readme, but really go use the [ASP.NET-Core-Basics](https://github.com/elanderson/ASP.NET-Core-Basics) repo instead
#### Getting started with ASP.NET-Core-SPAs
#####[This](http://www.elanderson.net/2016/02/asp-net-core-project-with-angular-2-aurelia-and-an-api/) blog post is a guide to get the code up and running.

#### Why
#####This project will gives a jumping off point to experiment with [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) and [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) from inside the same project. Both of these frameworks repersent the next generation of [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) frameworks.
